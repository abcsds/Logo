# Logo
Experiments on logo programming language.
Most of these are done with python `turtle` medule, wich needs to be installed:
```
pip install turtle
```
This module has the basic commands in logo and can be used in combination with python grammar. Ideal for programming classes for kids.
I've done everything in black, cause I'm monochromatic like that, but more colors can be used. See the module's documentation:
